Goals
Let the user take mock tests of previous year papers of competitive exams and other available free mock test papers and analyse their performance in tests and also create their SPI and a rank predictor on the basis of their present performance.
Allow the users to create their own private tests and host them for a group and try to minimise the chance of cheating.
Allow the users to create their own set of practice questions from the textbooks relevant to their course or from the set of available questions which will be categorized topic-wise as well as on the basis of difficulty level and let them practice those questions by creating their own real time test environment.
Make the user interface of the tests as close as possible to the actual examination interface.
Make a discussion forum where students can actively take part in discussions and help each other in solving the doubts.
Create a newsfeed, for displaying all the news, resources, tutorials from YouTube, book recommendations, download links,  blogs, experiences of other people who are there in the position which the student seeks and all the relevant and useful content in accord with the interest of the student which will be asked at the time of registration.
The users can bookmark questions for future reference and save the links from the news feed to be referred later.
Specifications
The user will be asked to register wherein weâ€™ll ask the interest of the user and provide the features like relevant tests and newsfeed accordingly.

To access some advanced features we will ask the students for their feedback and suggestions, the questions which they wish to be added to the website, one question each student, a textbook suggestion and the link to their favourite resource (YouTube/blog/ website) for any topic in their course.
